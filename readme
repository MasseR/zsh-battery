Battery status bar. Reads battery status information and prints colored
unicode triangles representing battery status. In this implementation the
color codes are for zsh.

Usage example:

With zsh you need to have prompt_subst on as it allows prompt to substitute
variables 'live' instead of just doing it once.

I put the bars to the right prompt (RPROMPT) but your mileage may wary

setopt prompt_subst
RPROMPT="\$(battery)"
